<h2>Hacker</h2>
<p>A computer hacker is any skilled computer expert that uses their technical
 knowledge to overcome a problem. While "hacker" can refer to any skilled
  computer programmer, the term has become associated in popular culture with
   a "security hacker", someone who, with their technical knowledge, uses bugs
   or exploits to break into computer systems. </p>
